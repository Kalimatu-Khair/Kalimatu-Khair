- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kalimatu-Khair (Arabic for "A Benevolent word")

I'm from the MENA region (Middle East & North Africa; i.e., the Arab-sphere)

I can't code, but I am a translator, and I'm here mostly to help out the open-source community as much as I can by translating projects into the languages I speak.

Looking forward to collaborate on projects that help push humanity further ahead.

- ðŸ“« If you have a project that you want translated into Arabic (espcially if it's related to languages somehow but not necessarily so), you can reach me here or using my mail:
writeword.iy8s6@slmail.me

I would be happy to support and contribute to the FOSS community with the skills I have.ty with the skills I have.
